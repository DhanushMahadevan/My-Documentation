Routing protocols:

RIP(Routing information protocol)
(Shortest path - Least no of router or low hop counts)
(distance vector protocol) 
(Note: Which send updated ips to the another router in Every 30 Secs)
- First routing protocol is introduced. Based on Hop count( packets are passed by how many routers to reach the destination router )
which is counted from 1st router or network router


WE CAN SEE THE RIP ROUTING TABLE IN TYPE CONNECTION AS C(DIRECT CONNECT) & R(FROM RIP EARNED UPDATED IP)
Note(Interview Questions):
When hop count is Zero.There is no supporting router(Inbetween routers) to route the destination router 
When we connect the same router network.
when Inbetween routers are played, we must count the hop

OSPF(Speedest path)(link vector protocol)(Based on serial cable( 1.5mbps) or ethernet(faster than serial) or fast ethernet(10 mbps faster than both serial and ethernet))
