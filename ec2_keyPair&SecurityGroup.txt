* IF U WANT TO IMPORT A KEY IN ACROSS THE REGION. YOU SHOULD HAVE .PUB FILE OF PUBLIC KEY WHICH IS GENERATE FROM PUTTYGEN (PEM OR PPK FILE). AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SAVE AS .PUB EXTENSION.

* IF WE WANT TO CONNECT A INSTANCE BY PUBLIC IP,YES WE CAN !. BY USING THE CMD: ssh -i key ec2-user@publicip


key pair:

1. Need to connect putty - use private key in putty gen when convert to ppk.
Misc: Provide keypassphrase if we want (extra protection).

2. Need to import key in aws - use public key to save and import in aws key pairs.

Security Groups :
INBOUNDS:
* ssh - my ip - which connects only putty app.
* ssh - anywhere ipv4 - both aws terminal and putty. 

* http - my ip - router connected devices can see the web app.
* http - anywhere - all connected to the internet with distant isp's.

* https - my ip or anywhere - need ssl certifcate and do same as http.

* All tcp - my ip - which connects both putty app and can see routed connected devices the web app & 
 all port deployments.
* All tcp - all ip - which connects both putty app and aws terminal &
all port deployments

OUTBOUND:

* HTTPS - Anywhere- For downloading update and major packages are located in https web server , So https is enough.

* 

* ICMP ipv4 - echo request and echo response - anywhere 
------------------------------------------------------------------
CONNECTING TWO INSTANCE BY SSH CMD:

INBOUND:
* ssh - SG of intend to connect the instance or THEIR SUBNET IP(WHEN TWO SECURITY GROUPS )

ALTERNATIVE :
*ssh - Anywhere   and make sure outbound ssh - anywhere

-----------------------------------------------------------------

VPC PEERING:
INBOUND AND OUTBOUND:
* ICMP IPV4 - SG OF A ANOTHER INSTANCE . DO ON BOTH SECURITY GROUPS LIKE PUTTING INBOUND AND OUTBOUND OF ANOTHER SECURITY.(MORE SECURE)
* ICMP IPV4 - ANYWHERE ON BOTH INSTANCE. IT WOULD SEND ECHO REQUEST AND ECHO RESPONSE ON BOTH INSTANCES. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

VPC ENDPOINT:

INBOUND RULE:
HTTPS - VPC IP  

ALTERNATIVE METHOD:
CREATE OWN SECURITY GROUP AND AND PUT INBOUND RULE AS ABOVE .


-------------------------------------------------------------------

EFS:

INBOUND RULE:

NFS - ANYWHERE
