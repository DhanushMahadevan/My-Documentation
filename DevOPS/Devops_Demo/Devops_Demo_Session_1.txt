linux admin-cloud op-devops eng

after dev we will work as a devops

devops - log back,service start automate by shell script or python

Note: scripting is mandatory. either shell or python.

DEVOPS DEFINITION:
----------------
devops is a cultural approach OR methodology or process by doing work with many tools and delivery the app(smoothly,efficiently)to our clients.

SDLC BASIC NEED TO KNOW (WATERFALL AND AGILE METHODS) FOR DEVOPS ENV.

LINUX IS MUST FOR DEVOPS CAUSE MANY SERVER ARE RUNNING ON IT.

NOTE:

PROJECTS ARE MUST FOR LINUX OR AWS OR DEVOPS .IT HELPS US TO RESUME IN PROJECTS INSTEAD OF WORK EXPERIENCE.

-----------------------------------------
MODULE1 :DEVOPS INTRO:
SDLC IS PRE-REQUESTES TO KNOW BEFORE ENTERING THE DEVOPS ENV.
--------------------------------------
MODULE2: LINUX OS:
shell scripting but we will learn python scripting
15 DAYS PATCHING,BACKUP 
-----------------------------------
MODULE3: AWS CLOUD(STRONG COMPUTE LEVEL):
1.EC2,

2.EBS(),

3.LOAD BALACNER(MULTIPLE INSTANCE,INCOMING T0 TRAFFIC WiTH DISTANT INSTANCE),

4.AUTOSCALING(UNPREDETIVE SCALE OUR INSTANCES)

5.S3(STORE ANY TYPE OF FILE),

6.ROUTE(PAAS-DOMAIN ONLY TO THE CLIENT),

7.LIGHTSAIL(),

8.VPC(SETUPING NETWORKS),

9.RDS(Paas -DYNAMO DB(No sql)),

10.CLOUDWATCH(MONITORING THE SERVCIES),

11.SES(EMAIL),

12.SQS(QUEUE SERVICE),

13.SNS(NOTIFICATION SERVICE),

14.BILLING OVERVIEW(SHOULD KNOW CLOUD ENG BASIC INFO ABOUT IT)

15.LAMBDA(MOST OF CMPY ARE SERVERLESS USED,IN SESSION VIDEO A IBM BACKEND DEV,CMP FREQUENTLY CHANGED THE ENVIRONMENT AS LAMBA, HE IS LaGGING THAT LAMBA IN AWS INFRA)

CREATE A INFRA :

NETWORK ENG

OS TEAM - SKILL  INSTALLING LINUX  

MIDDLEWARE -SETUP TO REQUIRED TO RUN THE APP

DB TEAM

BUILDER TEAM - DEVELOPEMENT(UNDER SDLC)

FINAL CLIENT

CONCS:

APP DELIVERY IS LATE,NEED MAINTAINS OURSELF,MOST OF COMPANY GOING WITH THE CLOUD.

PROC: COST-EFFECTIVE,NO MAINTAIN

NOTE:
MOST OF JOBS ARE CLOUD+DEV AFTER FEWER ARE CLOUD ONLY.
--------------------------------
MODULE-5: DEVOPS TOOLS

DEVOPS IS METHOLODY OR CULTURAL OR PROCESS TO  DELIVER THE APP TO THE CLIENT.

1.JENKINS(90%)-CD/CI-single pipleline

2.SONAR QUBE- ANY DUPICATE IN PRESENTED IN JENKINS.

3.SOURCE CODE MANAGEMENT(GIT(OPEN SOURCE)) TOOLS LIKE(GITLAB) - PLAY THE MULTIPLE DEVS IN THIS PLATFORM.

4.GRADLE,MAVEN:
WHEN CODE IS READY,
SERVER IS CAN'T KNOW THE CODE IN TEXT
SO WE NEED TO CONVERT INTO THE PKG

5.MONITIORING MANAGEMENT TOOLS:GRAFONA,SPLANK

6.CONFIGURE MANAGEMENT TOOLS(CODE DEPLOY):CHEF,ANSIBLE

7.CONTAINERING MANAGEMENT TOOLS:DOCKER & KUBERNETS:

	MOST OF CMPS DEPLOY APP IN CONTAINER SERVICES

8.TOMCAT & NEXUS(APP SERVER CAUSE APP ARE RUNNING IN TOMCAT,APACHE LIKE THAT.)

ELK(ELASTIC,LOG STASH)-pending

----------------
MODULE-5 PROJECTS:

NOTE:

WE SHOULD KNOW HOW WE ARE GOING TO DEPLOY AN APP INTO DEVOPS TOOLS FROM STRATCH OR END TO END PROCESS.

ANY OF THE PROGRAMMING WE MAY WORK IN DEV ENV. WE RECOMMENDED THE BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF PROGRAMMING LIKE(JAVA,PY,ANGULAR,REACT JS,FULLSTACK(BOOT+ANGULAR))
----------------------------
MODULE 6 INTERVIEW PREP:

KEYWORDS ARE REQURIED.

-----------------------
CONCEPTS:(PENDING)
