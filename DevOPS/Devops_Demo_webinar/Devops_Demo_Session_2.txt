MOUDLE 1: 

WHAT IS DEVOPS(DELIVERING APP FASTLY TO OUR CLIENTS):
 -DEVOPS IS NOT A TECH /TOOL/PROGRAMMING.

-DEVOPS IS A CULTURAL APPROACH/METHOLODY/PRACTICE/ SET OF TOOLS.

IN IT-CMPY:

DEV(DEVELOPING THE CODE) AND OPS(NETWORK,OS,MIDDLEWARE,DB)

NOTE:
ONCE CODE IS READY,THEY PUSH TO THE CENTRAL REPO LIKE GITHUB, AFTER THAT OPS DEV ,THEY SETUP THE ENVIRONMENT AND DEPLOY THE CODE IN SERVER AND FINALLY DELIVERY TO THE CLIENTS.

MAJOR TWO TEAMS(DEV TEAM AND OPS TEAM)
STEP 1: DEV TEAM(RESPONSIBLE TO DEVELOP CODE).

STEP2: TESTING TEAM(TESTERS WHERE THEY PERFORM TESTING THE CODE).

STEP 3: OPERATIONS TEAM(RESPONSIBLE TO SETUP ENV,DEPLOY TO THE SERVER AND FINALLY DELIVER TO THE CLIENTS)

NOWDAYS MOST OF ORGANISATIONS ARE FOLLOWING THE DEVOPS PRACTICES.

- DEVOPS IS A SET OF PRACTICES THAT COMBINES DEV AND OPS 

AFTER THE CODE IS READY ,THEY PULL THE CODE TO A REPO AND DEVOPS TEAM SETUP THE ENV BASED 
THAT CODE HAS TO BE DEPLOY INTO THE SERVER

BASIC: (COMPANY WORK ENVIROMENT)
THERE ARE SEVERAL ENV IN IT :

DEV ENV , TEST ENV ,UAT ENV ,PREPROD AND FINAALY SERVER IT IS ACCESSED BY END USERS.


STEPS OF IT ENV PROGRESSION:

1. FIRSTLY, DEVOPS IS SETUP THE ENV  TO THE DEV TEAM BASED  ON CLIENT. 

2. DEV TEAM - DEVELOPING THE CODE,WHEN THE CODE IS READY THEY PUSH TO REPO.

3. TEST TEAM - THEY CHECK THE IS THE BUTTON WORKING OR NOT. GENERATE THE REPORT.  

4.UAT(USER ACCEPTANCE TEST) ENV -HERE THAT CLIENT - TESTS THE APP BY CLIENT.

5. PREPOD ENV - CHECKS THE SERVER PREFORMANCE, FOR EG: ROUTES INCOMING TRAFFIC. FREQUENTLY CONTACT TO CLIENT(IT IS OK TO 10 SERVER ,HOW MANY TRAFFIC WE WILL FACE) 

6. PRODUCTION ENV(SERVER)


DEVOPS TOOLS ARE AUTOMATION TOOLS DELIVER THE APP FASTLY.

THE MAIN AIM OF DEVOPS IS REDUCE SOFT DEV LIFECYCLE PEROID(SDLC)(COMPLETE THE DEV TO DELIVER THE PROCESS).

NOTE:
IN MARKET 100 OF DEVOPS TOOLS.

JUST UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE GOING TO DELIVERY APPLICATION TO CLIENT WORKING WITH SEVERAL TOOLS.

-------------------------DEVOPS TOOLS------------

BY USING THE DEVOPS TOOLS, WE MAKE THE DEV TEAM AND OPS TEAM COLLABARATION WITH DEVOPS TOOLS.

DEVOPS WORK FLOW:
1. LINUX OS - OS INSTALLATION

2. AWS-SETUP ENV FOR DEV TO WRITE THE CODE 

3.GITHUB -SOURCE CODE MGMT-CREATE THE BRACHES,DEBUG BRACHES,

4.MAVEN 

5.SONAR QUBE - 

6.NEXUS - DEV REPO S3 BUCKET MAINTAINING
(PKG REPO,CAUSE SERVER CAN'T UNDERSTAND ONLY PKG)

7. TERRAFORM(IAC) - HOW TO CREATE THE SERVER
 AND PROVIDE IAAS
ONCE THE SERVER ARE READY

8. ANSIBLE OR CHEF(OUT DATED)-CONFIG MGMT TOOL(cmp(config mgmt) tool)

9. JENKINS - INTERGRATING THE ALL THE ABOVE TOOLS

NOW ALL THE CONTAINERS INSIDE THE LOT OF SERVER

10. DOCKER-(LAKSH OF SERVER MANAGEMENT BY CONTAINERS)

11.KUBERNETS - ALTER OF DOCKER

12. GRAFONA ,SPLUNK -MONITORING THE ENVIRONMENT 
IMPORTANT - IT WILL IMPACT THE CUSTOMER, BUSINESS,-EVERY DAY MONITOR 
 WE CAN'T MONITORING 100 SERVERS EACH OF THEM  SEPARATELY SO, MONTORING TOOLS LIKE CLOUDWATCH,PROMOTUES,GRAFANA(LOGS)

NOTE:

SEND THE LOG TO THE DEV TEAM BY SCRPITING THAT'S WHY WE ARE LEARN THE SCRIPTING.

ABOVE 12 TOOLS ARE ELK TOOLS
