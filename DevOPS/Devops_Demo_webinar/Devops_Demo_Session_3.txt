----------MODULE 2----------------:

SDLC(SOFTWARE DEVELOPEMENT LIFE CYCLE ):

IN ANY SOFT FROM DEV TO DELIVER TO THE CLIENTS ,WE CALL IT AS A SDLC.

SDLC REPRESENTS HOW ONE SOFT WILL BE DEVELOPED AND DELIVERED INTO THE MARKET:

----------SDLC PHASES-----------------

1.FEASIBLE STUDY
2.THE REQUIREMENT ANAYSIS BY SAMPLE WEBPAGE BY CLIENTS.
 
IN ORGANISATION BUSINESS TEAM - COLLECT THE REQURIMENTS FROM THE CLIENTS.

- COLLECTING REQUIREMENTS.
- ANALYSIS THE REQUIREMENTS IS IT FEASIBLE TO WORK,TIME,MAN POWER,BUDGET.
- DESIGN THE PROJECT(UML DIAGRAMS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT,DOCS ABOUT )
- DEVELOP THE PROJECT(CLIENT DOESN'T BOTHER ABOUT WHICH PROGRAM IS RUNNING,HE ONLY NEEDS THE PERFORMANCE,FUNCTIONALITY)..
- TESTING THE PROJECT.
- DEPLOY THE PROJECT.
- DELIVER THE PROJECT TO THE CLIENTS.

EXAMPLE :
IF WE WANT OT BUILD A HOUSE,

WE PROVIDE ALL REQUIREMENTS TO THE BULDIER LIKE I NEED 4 ROOMS AND ONE HALL ONE KITCHEN FOR ETC....

THEN BULIDER WILL ANALYSIS, IS IT FEASIBLE TO BUILD THAT PLACE AND ANALYSIS ALL THE REQUIREMENTS LIKE BUDGET 

HE WILL GIVE THE DESIGN(DESIGN BY ARCHITECT)
FINALLY BUILD THE CONSTRUCTIONS.


BUSINESS TEAM
--------------------
COLLECT THE REQUIREMENTS FROM CLIENTS 

WE HAVE 2 TEAMS:


DEV TEAM
-----------------
- ANALYSE THE REQUIREMENTS FROM BUSINESS CLIENTS
- DESIGN THE PROJECT
- DEVELOP THE PROJECT
- TEST THE PROJECT

OP TEAM
-------------------

- SETUP THE ENV
- BULID THE PROJECT
- DEPLOY THE PROJECT
- DELIVER THE PROJECT
- MONITOR THE PROJECT

----------------------------------------
WATERFALL METHOD(LINEAR METHOD,BEST TEAM, NOT REVERSABLE PROCESS OR BACKTRACING CHANGES NOT POSSIBLE)

- IT'S FIRST AND FORMOST METHOD WHICH USED TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER THE PROJECT.

 - FOLLOWS LINEAR METHOD CANNOT DONE BY PARREL PHASES.

 - WHEN CURRENT PHASE IS COMPLETED THEN ONLY MOVE TO THE NEXT PHASE.

CONS:
- MANY DRAWBACKS ARE EXISTED.BECAUSE CURRENT PHASES IS DEPENDED ON NEXT PHASES LIKE WHEN  CURRENT PHASES IS PROGESSION ,THE NEXT TEST HAS TO BE WAIT TO COMPLETE THE PREVIOUS PHASE.
  
- LOT OF TIME AND AMOUNT , LATE DELIVER

IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------
NOWDAYS EVERY CMPYS ARE FOLLOWED BY AGILE METHOD.......

3 TO 6 MONTHS TO ANALYSE THE REQUIREMENTS A PROJECT TRADITIONAL .

THE CLIENT INVOLVEMENT IS VERY LESS IN WATERFALL MODEL.

LIFE NOTE:
*NOW A DAYS BUSINESS KEEP ON CHANGING
HENCE WE CAN'T DO FIXED REQUIREMENTS.
 

THAT'S WHAT GOING TO THE AGILE METHOD:
*************************************

AGILE METHODOLOGY(CLIENT INVOLVEMENT IS VERY VERY HIGH, IT IS ADDED ADVANTAGE):

-IT IS NOT A METHODOLODY, IT IS SET OF TOOLS AND VALUES AND GOALS.

- PROJECT IS SPLITTED INTO SPRINT , 2 TO 4 WEEKS TO COMPLETE SO CLIENT MONITOR ALL THE THINGS 

-EACH SPRINT WILL HAVE 7 STAGES OF SDLC

- don't lose the track of your daily standups

-SEE CLEAN COMMUNICATIONS FOR YOUR 

DAILY TASKS:

DEV TOOL (JENKINS) - MULTIPLE  DEV TO WORK WITH FOR CODE TO THE REPO(GITHUB) AND AUTOMATICALLY THE JENKINS WILL FETCH THE CODE  MAVEN,GRADLEM,SONAR QUAR DEPLOY ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE DELIVERY OR RELEASE ON THE SERVER

EXAMPLE:

IMPORTANT NOTE:
FINALLY FIRST SPRINT  IS RELEASED , IF CLIENT IS WANT A NEW FEATURE, THEN NEXT SPRINT IS GET STARTED.

TRACK THE EVERY TEAM BY USING RALLY APP
