Kubernetes
------------

Docker vs k8s:
----------------
1. Docker - container platform

Cons:

* Ephemeral(Short life, container consumes cpu so it will die for cpu utilize, so all container will die by process id) - depended-Single host

* No Self healing

* No Autoscaling

* No LoadBalancing

* No Enterprise Support Level, Unless using Docker swarm.

[Note: Enterprise Support level Standards (prod server) are ,

-> Load Balancer
-> Firewall
-> Autoscale
-> Self Healing
-> API Gateway ].

2. K8s - container orchestration tool - By default k8s is a Cluster(Group of Nodes with master/ node architecture like jenkins)

Pros:

[ It resolves above cons of Docker, They are,]

* Cluster

* ReplicaSet - HPA(Autoscaling)

* Auto Healing - k8s control the pod/container and fix the damaged pod/container 

* Enterprise Nature.

*  Kube-proxy(Round Robin) load balancing and Advanced Ingress Controller for load balancing.
