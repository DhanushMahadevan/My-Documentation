GIT:


CMD FLOW(After config user and email and remote add cmd):

1. Create a feature branch and do git checkout feature_branch

2. Create a dir and do git init

3. git add .

4. git commit -m "message"

5. git log --oneline or git log --stat

6. git push docs feature_branch

7. git checkout master

8. git merge feature_docs

9. git push docs master

BEST PRATICE:

1. Create a feature branch and do git checkout feature_branch

2. Create a dir and do git init

3. git add .

4. git commit -m "First three commits" and do git log --oneline or git log --stat

5. git branch dev

6. git checkout dev

7. Made some changes like Fourth commit 

8. check git log on both branches like does any changes made?.

9. git rebase master

10. git checkout master

11. git merge dev

12. git branch -d dev (Cause, we should delete the branch after the merge from dev. we don't nolonger)


TO AVOID UPDATE NON-FASTFORWARD ERROE WHILE PUSHING:

1. mkdir git && cd git && git init
2. git remote -v
3. git remote add code https://github.com/DhanushMahadevan/learning-website.git
4. git remote -v
5. git log
6. git pull code master
7. git log
8.history | tail
9.vim  index.html
10.git commit -am "changes made"
11.git push code master


PRE-REQUESTS:

1.*****STOP THE INSTANCE DON'T DO TERMINATE THE INSTANCE,

2. CREATE A DIR LIKE DAY1,DAY2 LIKE THIS 
DO GIT INIT FOR ONE TIME IN A LIFE OR DELETE THE DIR,CREATE THE DIR,GIT INIT. AND WORK ON IT OR{Don't delete the content after push .Everything is trackable, if we delete,next time we will push it will also deleted the pushed contents previously}.***********

2. CREATE A NEW DIR FOR 
3. AND MAKE SURE CREATE OUR OWN BRANCH.DON'T DO IN MASTER BRANCH 

DO FORK BEFORE 90 DAYS, CAUSE IT WILL DELETED AUTOMATICALLY OUR REPO WHEN WE HAVEN'T BEEN USING OUR REPO FOR 90 DAYS.

INTERVIEW :

THEY ARE ASKING FOR CMD AS MUCH AS THEORY. SO CONCENTRATE ON CMD.

TASK: PULL VS CLONE VS FETCH

FETCH : LOCAL REPO UPDATE.

PULL: BOTH LOCAL REPO AND WORKSPACE UPDATE.

CLONE: DUPLICATES FROM REMOTE REPO TO OUR LOCAL MACHINE.

DEFINITION:

GIT is a distributed version-control system which can track our code.

red color - not move to the staging area

green color - staging area
DAY 1:

1. Install git in local
 
PRE-REQUEST:(USERNAME AND MAIL IS SAME AS GITHUB ACCOUNT)
 git config --global user.name "Dhanush-Mahadevan" 
git config --global user.email "dhanushlogesh62@gmail.com"

NOTE : THEY CAN RUN WITHOUT GLOBAL FLAGS, WHEN THEY WANT TO COMMIT TO THE LOCAL REPO OF SPECIFIC DIRS OF THE SPECIFIC USERS.
BUT BEST PRATICE, MAKE SURE RUN AS GLOBAL FLAGS FOR USING ONE MACHINE -  ONE USER.

2. Create a dir

3. Inside that dir, create local repo - git init (Which creates an hidden dir of empty repo LIKE .git dir, THAT MEANS CREATS LOCAL REPO)
{LOCAL REPO COMMON FOR ALL BRANCHES}

4. Create a file and add content into as First line.

5. To see the status of the file - git status (long format)or git status -s (Which shows ??(untracked file , That is not tracked by git ) file-name)

{If git status -s cmd is return nothing, all the working dir is committed in local repo, That is working tree is clean. Use git status - it returns detail in the previous sentence}

6. *********** GO through the green-tech-devops-first-video(55:51) - It displays the screenshot of lifecycle of the git flow  ************

7. We should move to staging area of our work -(git add)

8. After that, In the end we should move to the local repo. Cause it gets the logs(history) of when we move to the local repo.- (git commit -m 'message'). So when new features is successfully added. Then commit to the local repo.

{EXECUTING ADD AND COMMIT in one cmd:

PRE-REQUESTS:
 IN BELOW CMD IS WORK ON AFTER THE FIRST COMMIT. IF WE DO IN FIRST COMMIT . IT WILL ASKING FOR FIRST ADD AND COMMIT IN TWO STEPS.

git commit -a -m or -am "message"}

SCEANRIO:

DEVELOPER MOVES TO THE LOCAL REPO WHEN THEY GOT SHIFTED OUT OF THE COMPANY(EVENING) , SO BEFORE EVENING THEY ARE ONLY MOVE TO STAGING AREA. BUT SOME PEOPLE MOVE THEIR CODE 2 -3 DAYS WORK DONE. AFTER THAT WE WILL COMMIT IN LOCAL REPO.

9. Moving our file from working directory to staging area:
	git add file-name(which shows A file-name, That means it has been added)

10. Moving our file from staging area to local repo

	git commit -m "first commit" (which shows successfully commit. *******But if we skip the PRE-REQUESTS ,it needs name and email address of the person who's moving that file(global config of user and email*******)).

{ After FIRST COMMIT, BRANCH IS CREATED do git branch: returns the branch name. BEFORE COMMIT DO : git branch  
 nothing returns.}

11. git log or git log --oneline  (which shows of the git logs after commit of the HEAD, it differ from many branches based on head of that particular branch)

12. If we want to see the content of the file after commit:
	git show commit-id(commit-ids are get from executing git log or git log --oneline cmd) 
-----------------------------------DAY 2:

13. Editing existing file:
	-> ASSUMATION OF SCENARIO: I AM COMING DAY 2 , ADD SOME CODE ON THAT FILE

	 Add some content on that file. Now Then Check the status of the file(NOTE : DON'T USE FILE NAME WHILING git status -s )

14. git status -s (Now It returns the red colored M file-name(modify,cause in the day 1,we had added some content and return green colored A  file-name.  So now red-coloredM file-name))

NOTE:
****************
HERE I  MENTIONED RED AND GREEN COLOR.  GO THROUGH THE FIRST FEW LINES OF THIS DOCS*********

15. Now I added to staging area :
	git add file-name(The red colored M willbe changed as green colored M . when executing git status -s(short). cause now successfully move to the staging area)

16. git commit -m "Second commit"

17. git log OR git log --oneline(short details) (2 logs are displayed)

18. git show commit-id

NOTE:

IF  WE HAVE THE COMMIT-ID WE CAN EASILY TRACK OUR CHANGES BY EXECUTING git show commit-id

---------------------------------

PUSHING OUR CODE TO REMOTE REPO:

PRE-REQUSTS:

GITHUB ACCOUNT(PUBLICLY NOT COMPELETELY FREE OR PRIVATE NOT COMPLETELY FREE , Green-tech says there is threshold is maintain by github)

STEPS in GITHUB A/C:

1. Create a repo as Name-date (Documentation2901)

2. public(checkin) or private 

3. click create repo button

4. They will give the link

STEPS IN GIT:


PRE-REQUESTS:

	1. CREATE PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN on github a/c -> Developer settings:
 
	In terminal:git remote set-url alias-name-of-url https://accesstoken@github.com/dhanush.........git
	
	2.git remote add name (like aliasoftheurl we can specify anything name in aliasoftheurl) url (repolink of github)

eg. git remote add hdfc https://github.com/dhanlog/repo-name.git

	3. Change default branch as master,if not showed in github .create a branch and push to remote(github). 

1. ***** git push ->  enter -> which displays the warning If we skip the PRE-REQUESTS , first we should create an url and then we will push anything.

2. git remote (which shows the aliasname of the url like hdfc(project-name)) url

3. git push name(name is nothing, the alias of the name) master(branch master or  if we have branch we can specify as a branch)

eg. git push hdfc master or git push -f(forcefully) -u(up-stream) hdfc master

OUTPUT OF THE ABOVE CMD IS ASKING FOR GITHUB USERNAME AND PASSWORD

4. FINALLY WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY PUSH OUR CODE TO THE REMOTE REPO OF THE MASTER BRANCH

5. Reload the GITHUB Page.

6. Now then, we will see the commits of 2 in github page


NOTE*******************************:

WHEN WE SELECT THE COMMITS , WE WILL SEE THE EXACT CODE AS PRESENT AS WHEN THEY HAD COMMITTED OF THE DAY.
MISC:

GO TO THE EXPLORE PAGE IN GITHUB , WE WILL SEE THE GLOBAL USER OF THE GITHUB , SELECT TRENDING , THEY WILL HAVE 4000 5000 COMMITS ARE THERE.
