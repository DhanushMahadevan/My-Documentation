GIT REBASE:

PRE-REQUESTS: git rebase is run as
feature_branch

DEFINITION:
	Merge the head(aka base) of feature_branch to master head(aka base). So it is known as rebase


Scenario:
	When we add some  feature in our code. 

Steps:
1. We add in our feature_branch. 

2. Add a feature in it as a new filename in the feature_branch,commit it as the new filename.

3. git rebase master (cmd executed from feature_branch)

output: First, rewinding head our replay your work in top of it(which means we have rewinded from master or changes in master).

4. git log - which shows the all commit of master branch and   our feature branch too.

5. git merge dev - cmd from master

GIT WORK-FLOW:

NOTE: 
	DEPENDS ON COMPANY AND PROJECT MIGHT BE DIFFER IN WORK-FLOW.WE SHOULD DEFINE OUR WORK-FLOW.

SCENARIO:
	IF WE ARE WANT TO WORK WITH GIT WE SHOULD HAVE GITHUB ACCOUNT.WITHOUT GITHUB, WE WON'T PUSH TO REMOTE REPO (CONFIG USER.NAME & USER.EMAIL)


WORK-FLOW STEPS:
-------------------
1. WE ARE FORKED OUR WORK FROM 
CLIENT GITHUB(OWNERSHIP OF THE 
GITHUB REPO SYMBOL -> A BOOK 
PRESENT IN REPO NAME) IN OUR 
COMPANY REMOTE REPO(OWNERSHIP PF 
THE GIHUB REPO SYMBOL -> FORKED).

2. WHEN NOOBIE DEVELOPER APPEARED 
IN OUR COMPANY, THEY WILL USE CLONE 
CMD FOR LOCAL REPO. IT HAS ALSO 
PRESENT IN .GIT FOLDER(Which means 
initiliazed git folder).

3. After the execution of (git 
clone github-link) cmd, do git log 
which shows the origin. 

4. git branch -a - which shows hidden branches that is remote repo.

5. git branch dev

6. git checkout dev

7. Made some changes and commit it.

8. git remote - which shows origin.cause we have been forked

9. git push origin dev - For tester and other developers to approve our code.

10. git log 

11. After the approved from tester to merge to master git checkout master 

12. git pull origin master - which update the lastest update from remote to local

13. git merge dev

14. Delete the feature branch in local repo after successfully merged.
	cmd: git branch -d dev

15. Delete the feature branch in remote repo.
	cmd:git push origin --delete dev

16. Now then, we have only master flawlessly or cleanly :).

17. Finally we have requested to pull to the client for my 1 or 2 months work in standard release.
