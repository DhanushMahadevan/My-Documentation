git remote add alias <url>
git push alias master

INTERVIEW: 

1. WORKFLOW AND STRATEGIES OF THE GIT.

2.************************************** DAY TO DAY LIFE TASK ISSUE:************** Solve Merge conflict using git merge conflict tools . but most of the dev using vscode,sublime,atom solved by visually, In interview, they will asking merge conflict using git tools.

3.GIT  CMDS.


WHAT IS MASTER:

BASIC:
When we do execute a first commit cmd, it will create a master branch(like tree). Then we made some changes in code and second commit. it also under the master branch

NOTE:
IN GIT, We create multiple branches, then we will start working in the branches.

1. CHECKING BRANCHING IN OUR DIR OR LOCAL REPO:

git branch OR git branch -a(hidden {which means remote repo}) - if it returns the nothing. it means it don't have created any branch.Cause we're doing first commit, the branch will creates

INTERVIEW QUESTION:

What is HEAD:
It is presented in last committed of our git regardless many branches are there, 

e.g if we commit in first time , it is head. if we do second commit, it is head. then first commit is not a head and so on.

-----------------------------------

EXECUTING ADD AND COMMIT in one cmd:

PRE-REQUESTS:
 IN BELOW CMD IS WORK ON AFTER THE FIRST COMMIT. IF WE DO IN FIRST COMMIT . IT WILL ASKING FOR FIRST ADD AND COMMIT IN TWO STEPS.

git commit -a -m or -am "message"

-----------------------------------
BASIC **************please take a look :
WE DON'T DO  CHANGES LIKE ADDING 

FEATURE IN MASTER BRANCH.Cause the 
Testing team push the code by pull 
cmd or QUALITY ASSURANCE TEAM 
tested our newly feature added code 
from feature branch. When they

approved our new feature from 
testing team. Finally we commit to 
the master branch(merge cmd plays).

 Unless disapprove our new feauture 
we work.SO WE HAVE TO CREATE A 
FEATURE BRANCH NAME IT AS WE 
DESIRED and work on it.

Virtuality of file:

Which means we can keep a file in virtual of many  other branches.

e.g if we have changed in feature branch file, and do commit . it will no affect in the master branch

ADD A NEW BRANCH:

WHY SHOULD I CREATE NEW BRANCH?

ANSWER: I will handle something called workorder-it means add a feature or solve the bug in the existing code.(ticketing tools like servicenow,jira)

CMD: git branch - (it will return branch names)

git branch branch-name(like dev,test) - it will add branch name.

AND THEN,

git branch -it shows branch names with recent added branch also.

NOTE: * -It's denoted current branch
---------------------------------

SWITHCHING B/W BRANCHES:

CMD: git checkout branch-name

NOW THEN, git branch - That * it pointed to the current switched branch 


do ls cmd- we can see the same copy of the master branch


if we do commit , it willcommit only dev(feature branch)

and do git log - it show the log info of the HEAD-> DEV,


----------------------------------
MERGE CMD :

Cons:
it merges all over from the branch , If we want to get specific commit Do cherrypick (Cherrypick is presented in GIT-3.txt file)

ADDING THE FEATURE BRANCH TO MASTER BRANCH

Types of merge:
1. SMOOTH MERGE(witout overwritten)
2. MERGE CONFLICT(overwritten)

NOTE: BUT BOTH TYPES ARE USED IN SAME CMD AS: git merge branch-name

 Before merging, we should do 3 operations:

 i) check the branch is master (git branch) 
 ii) git pull docs master

iii)git log - check the previous commits in master for merging new commits to the master.

 iv)  git merge dev

  v) Delete the feature branch after successfully merged.
	cmd: git branch -d branch-name

1. SMOOTH MERGE:
 
git log - commmit -id(HEAD-> MASTER, SBI/DEV,DEV)

WHERE, 
HEAD -> MASTER - IN LOCAL REPO , EVERYTHING IS COMMITED IN MASTER BRANCH

SBI/DEV - IN REMOTE IN FEATURE BRANCH

DEV - IN LOCAL REPO , EVERYTHING IS COMMITED IN FEATURE BRANCH

check the video @57:13. IF ABOVE WHERE IS NOT UNDERSTANDABLE.

Finally 
git push docs master- the merged commit are pushed to remote



git log - commmit -id(HEAD-> MASTER,SBI/MASTER ,SBI/DEV,DEV) - WHICH BOTH FEATURE AND MASTER BRANCH IS SUCCCESSFULLY PUSHED IN REMOTE.

-----------------------------------
2.MERGE CONFLICT

i) In Master , create a file and add a first line

ii) Add the second line and commit it.

iii) Create a new feature branch

iv) create third line in feature branch and commit it.

v) do merge - we will the merge conflict through an error

vi)************************************** DAY TO DAY LIFE TASK ISSUE:************** Using Merge tool(vimdiff) , to solve the merge conflict (specified top page of Interview) - gothrough github docs for git merge tool

vii) git config --global merge.tool vimdiff && - mergetool config

	git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3 && - it shows 3 info like local(master),base(previous commit),remote(merging branch from another branch) spilt in output screen

	git config --global mergetool.prompt false - To avoid asking for starting the vimdiff
 
viii) Execute git mergetool and  Moving cursor to the four screen - ctrl + shift + w + w

ix) editing the file:

enter esc for command mode

:diffg RE # get from REMOTE
:diffg BA # get from BASE
:diffg LO # get from  LOCAL

And type one of the above cmd ,SHIFT+Enter to change

x) Quitting from all editors - :wqa!

xi) do ls in terminal - it show 2 files like filename filename.orig.

NOTE:

IF we do git status -s -> it is automatically added in staging area implicitly .Cause we have saved in git mergetool editor.

xi) So git commit -m "Final commit"
