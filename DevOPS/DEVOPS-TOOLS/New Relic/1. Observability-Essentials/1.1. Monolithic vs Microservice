                                          ######################## EVOLUTION OF MODERN APP DEVELOPMENT #######################################

MONOLITHIC APPS:

In the early days - Internet(straightforward) - fewer code - single folder and server - Monolithic apps - Ease to maintain the stability. Fails - Consumer - forgiving those days. 

Pros: For Smaller Application, Easier to Troubleshoot and find bugs
Cons: Single point failure, Hard to update & Long Development Cycle

MICROSERVICE APPS:

Today's Companies - maintain apps - more complex than monolithic apps. Modern apps - composed of many small modular and self-contained service - operate independently- Microservice apps.

Challenges in Microservice:

Managing a microservice arch - difficult - failure at any point - Cause System lead to outages, error, delayed responses and major monetary(money) losses. In Order to mange the modern apps a new style - waterfall to agile(ci/cd)

Pros: For Larger Applications. Each services inside the application could be assigned many teams to work concurrently(login, purchase, checkout and so on). Faster deliver  

Cons: Hard to Manage & Troubleshoot and so on.
