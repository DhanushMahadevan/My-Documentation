Entities:

 * An Entity is anything that reports data to New relic or contains data New Relic has access to.
 * Identified ny Unique ID (usually entityGuid) and Workloads (workloadGuid)
 * New Relic keeps track of relationship b/w entities

Workloads (From the business prespective, we manage the all new relic entities are group together based on distant businesses):

 * It is logical group of entities that could be an applications, hosts, cloud-services and even dashboards that we want to put together into a single view. That view is called workload.

Finding and Understanding entities:

 * From Explorer: See metadata and tags 
 
 * Viewing entity relationships:
  
    1. Related entities UI (Presented inside the each Entity in New Relic)
 
    2. Service maps (View of entity relationships in a Each entity and Also Click full map in related entites, It Directs to Service maps)

    3. Distributed traces (Let you follow the path of a transcation from end to end, possibly Starting with the browser or may be with one of our services on the backend. It is another place to see the realtionship b/w entities)

    4. Query with NerdGraph API (Query entities as well as relationships. 2 ways to define relationship b/w entites - {Tagging them & }

 * Grouping entities:
