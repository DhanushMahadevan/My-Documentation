Observability Platform:

 It's collect, store, manage, organize and transforms data into actionable, real-time illustrations of systems that correlate to business goals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instrumenting services with agents:

 * Observability platforms ingest data from our services with agents. Agents are integrated into a service through a process called instrumentation.

 * An Agent is typically a file or few lines of code that automatically collects data on your service and send it to the observability platform.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instrumenting Telemetry data in Newrelic (Layers - Agents - Events - Instrumentation):

1. UI/UX Layer - Browser and Mobile agent - PageViews and Interactions - pageviews, Ajax calls, JavaScript errors and mobile interactions. (This event generate transactions at the service layer)

2. Service Layer - APM agent - Transactions - Transactions and the errors with detailed timings with the app code.

3. Infra Layer - Infra agent - Samples & Flex Integration - System, process,network, on-host integrations and so on.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APM AGENT:

 * It Supports 8 languages : C, Java, PHP, Python, Golang, .Net, Node JS and Ruby . However, We can ingest any apps with help of OpenTelemetry that can be instrumented using OTel agent. 

 * Auto instrumentation.

 * Built in Distributed Tracing
 
 * It is identify our transactions with TraceIDs so that we can follow traces end to end from here.
 
 * We can capture loads of metrics directly from the app. we can also capture each event which is a transaction that our app execute.
 
 * It is customizable if we want to add a new field or new events a few lines of code  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BROWSER AGENT:

 For Real-time user experience 

 * Runs in End user's browser
 
 * Deploy with code snippet or Automatically via APM

 * Supports Core Web Vitals and Single Page Applications (SPA)
 
 * Extensible with customisations (e.g for business data)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INFRASTRUCTURE AGENT:
 
 * Monitoring the host resource and process metrics.
 * Log Forwarding and on-host integration data.
 * Also availble for docker & k8s.
 * Manageable via ansible, chef, puppet, etc


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ON-HOST INTEGRATION:

 If we don't have access to the code. But we still want to monitor that is a simple yaml file presented in the /etc dir while we're installing the infra agent.
 * Can create your own integrations using SDK or Flex


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLOUD INTEGRATIONS:
 * AWS, GCP, Azure
 * Configurable polling intervals
 * Most Key Services are supported


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network Monitoring

 * Monitoring for SNMP(Simple Network management protocol - used to monitor the network) and Network Flow devices.
 * Support for SNMP v1,v2c,v3.
 * Configurable polling frequency.
 * Targets devices across specific CIDR IP range
