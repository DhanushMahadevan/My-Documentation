VPC: 

subnet,route tables, internet gateways, elastic ip,NACL,SECURITY GROUP,ENDPOINTS,TRANSIT GATEWAY
/16 - /28

while creating a vpc, by default... eni, route table & acl will create

.0 --> network id
.1 --> reserved by aws for aws vpc router
.2 --> reserved by aws dns server
.3 --> for future use
.4 --> we can instance from this octent
.255 -->  Network broadcast address. We do not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore we reserve this address.


Q/A:

can we change the security group of an ec2 instance ?

Yes, it is possible to change the security group of an EC2 instance, even while it's running

------------------------
Setup VPC:

1. create vpc 
2. create subnet (public & private),route-table(public & private), associate subnet (public & private),internet gateway (public subnet)
-----------------------------
AZURE (WEST US use this region while creating , the reason of free tier resources are presented there most of cases  and also create route table that region) :

Note :
 * Likewise, create as aws . But there is no igw as aws. Instead there is option in route called internet we should  map as 0.0.0.0/0 in public explicitly.

 *  By default, there is no local route in route table as aws 
 * Route table is region specific
