AWS - CODE-DEPLOY(Ruby is needed) AND CODE-PIPELINE:

CODE DEPLOY(GENERIC DEVOPS: ANSIBLE - PYTHON IS NEEDED)

NOTE: IT IS FREE WHEN USING EC2 MACHINES.BUT PAID IN ON-PREMISES MACHINE

CODE PIPELINE(GENERIC DEVOPS: JENKINS - JAVA IS NEEDED)

WORKFLOW OF CI/CD:

SAMPLE INSTANCE -> S3(or git) ->code deploy(or ansible) -> PROD SERVER

Here CP is missing. Because of alignment issue by me.
But CP's role is create a pipeline. If any changes in s3, it fetch and update to the prod server.


TOOLS USED:
EC2, IAM, S3, CD, CP, CW, SNS.

CODE DEPLOY:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Deployment: The process of deployment.

PRE-REQUESTS:

USE TAGS FOR EC2. BECAUSE OF CODE DEPLOY ASKING FOR TAGS AND BEST PRATICE TOO.


Setup in Brief:

I have used two EC2 instance of AMZ2 Linux. First one is the web server we will be
configuring. also called CodeDeploy agent. Second EC2 machine is supposed to use by
developer where the codes are programmed. The names of the resources in the experiment
are arbitrary and may name the resources your own.

1. Create 2 IAM Roles for EC2-S3 (PROD MACHINE) & EC2-CodeDeploy access( we will configure in code deploy applcation likewise, lamba function(ec2-lamba)).

NOTE: WE CAN CREATE EC2-CODEPIPELINE role here. But we have option in code pipeline service.(It is our choose to create, we will either create role and attach to the code pipeline or create a new role code -pipeline there)

2. Create IAM user account(programmic access) for developer with s3 access & code deploy full access policies.

3. Install and prepare the CodeDeploy agent on webserver or prod server.

4. Create the code from Developer machine

5. Create Codedeploy Application and Push the code to S3 bucket from Developer
machine

6. Create Deployment Group to include web servers

7. Create Deployment to push the code to the webservers

8. Test the website configuration


2- Create IAM user account for developer

	a-Use the existing desktop/laptop or Launcha new EC2 instance. This is used by the
Developer for the code creation and manual pushing of code to $3 bucket.

	b-Create an IAM user and assign programming access. He should be given
Amazon$3FullAccess and AWSCodeDeployFulIAccess permissions

	c-execute aws configure command on developer's machine and install the access/secret
keys.

3- Install and prepare the CodeDeploy agent on webserver

	a-Launch the EC2 instance. This is used for deploying webserver with CodeDeploy.

	b-Create a Tag for the instance. The deployment group member ship for the EC2 instance is
decided by this Tag. I have used AppName Tag with value SampleApp.

	C-open the port 80 for Security Group since it is a web server.
	
	d- Attach the Role s3-ec2-full to this instance.


	e-SSH to the PROD Instance and su to root and execute the command below. This will download
the CodeDeply agent software and install. Make sure the you don't change the directory
during the process.


yum update
# yum install ruby-y
# yum install wget -y
#wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install
#chmod+x install
#./install auto
# service codedeploy agent status


4-Create the code from Developer machine

Note: you may copy the contents from this document to create code. scripts should be given
execute permissions

	a- SSH to developer machine. I have su to root and a created a directory /root/deploy_dir
	
	b- Make sure that zip file of thę of the code and its extracted directory is kept inside the
directory /root/deploy_dir. mýapplication name is sampleapp.
	
	c-Let us visit the code now. The output shows a sampleapp directory which is extracted
from the code sampleapp.zip

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
yaml file:

#cat sampleapp/ąppspec.yml

version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
-source:/ndex.html
 destination: /var/www/html/
hooks:
 Beforelnstall:
 -location: scripts/httpd_install.sh
  timeout: 300
  runas: root
 -location: scripts/httpd_start.sh
  timeout: 300
  runas: root
ApplicationStop:
 -location: scripts/httpd stop.sh
  timeout: 300
  runas: root

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scripts:
--------------------------------------------
cat sampleapp/scripts/httpd_install.sh

#!/bin/bash
yum install-y httpd

------------------------------------------------
cat sampleapp/scripts/httpd_start.sh

#!/bin/bash
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

------------------------------------------------
cat sampleapp/scripts/httpd_stop.sh

#!/bin/bash
systemctl stop httpd I
systemctl disable httpd

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5-Create Application & Push the code to S3 bucket:

	a-Create S3 bucket for uploading the code, I have named it as gir-sampleapp
	
	b-Change directory to sampleapp developer machine and create a codedeploy application.
execute the command below.

#aws deploy create-application -application-name sampleapp

	c-Now upload the code to $3 by the executing the command below. Directory of execution
is important.

#aws deploy push --application-name sampleapp -s3-location s3://gir-sampleapp/sampleapp.zip

	d- Now browse the s3 bucket to see that sampleapp.zip is present.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6-Create Deployment Group to include webserver(where we can specify lot of server mapping by their tags):

	a- Login to Codedepoly AWS web console

	b- Select sampleapp and click Create Deployment Group from Deployment Groups. 

	c-Enter the values like below and leave the other parameters default


Enter a deployment group name: mygrp

Choose a service role: cdrole

Deployment type: in-place

Environment configuration: choose Amazon EC2 instances

Key as AppName Value as SampleApp

Load balancer: uncheck Enable load balancing

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7-Create Deployment which pushes code to the webserver:

In the sampleapp click Create Deployment. Enter values like below. Other parameter can can
be kept default

Deployment group : mygrp

Revision type: My application is stored in Amazon S3

Revision location: s3://select_location_from list

Click Create Deployment to finish

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THOUGH HERE 1 - 7 DEPLOY PARTS IS OVER.

BUT THERE IS PROBLEM. WE SHOULD EXPLICITLY CHANGE IN INDEX. HTML AND S3 TOO. SO TO AVOID THIS SITUATION. WE HAVE "CODE PIPELINE".


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CODE PIPLINE:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

PRE-REQUESTS:

DO VERSIONING IN S3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to the code pipeline service

2. Choose the bucket and type sampleapp.zip as objectkey in next page

3. Enable cloudwatch events

4. code build - for war or jar file - So simply skip the stage. If we have java file. we can use build.

5. Add deploy stage -> choose an codedeploy
