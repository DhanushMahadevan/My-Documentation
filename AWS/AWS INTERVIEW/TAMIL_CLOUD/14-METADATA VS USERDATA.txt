USERDATA VS METADATA:

METADATA: GETTING DATA ABOUT INSTANCE AFTER LAUNCHED INSTANCED BY PASSING CMD:
curl http://public-ip/latest/meta-data/ami-id

USERDATA(BOOTSTRAPPING OR STARTUP SCRIPT):
RUN SOME ACTIONS WHILE LAUNCHING INSTANCE, MOST PROBABLY WE ARE USING SCRIPT TO PASS THE INSTANCE LIKE INSTALL SOME PKGS

USE CASE:
 * WHEN WE WANT TO GET LATEST DATA FROM S3 WHILING LAUNCHING INSTANCE WHEN EVERY TIME AUTO SCALING OUR INSTANCES.

* BASIC UPDATING OPERATIONS.
