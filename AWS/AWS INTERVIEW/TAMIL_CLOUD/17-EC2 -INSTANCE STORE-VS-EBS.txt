THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ROOT DEVICE TYPE (EBS AND INSTANCE STORE)

EC2 INSTANCE STORE VS EBS:

EC2 INSTANCE STORE(SSD,HDD,NO SNAPSHOT):

1. Local to instance

2. Non-presistent data store

3. Data not replicated (by default)

4. No Snapshot Support

5. SSD or HDD

cons:
If we stop the instance , the data will deleted.

USE CASES:
HIGH LATENCY FOR INITIAL STAGE,BUT MOST EBS IS USED

TERMINILOGY:
Ephermeral - Which storage is attached to the instance by default 



------------------------
ELASTIC BLOCK STORE(Gp2,io1,st1,sc1)

1. Persistent block storage volumes 99.999% availability

2. Automatically replicated within its Azs

3. Point-in-time snapshot  support

4. Modify volume type as needs change SSD or HDD

5. Auto recovery.

TERMINILOGY:

Non Ephermeral - Storage is not attached to the instance by default ,but located in somewhere like ebs
