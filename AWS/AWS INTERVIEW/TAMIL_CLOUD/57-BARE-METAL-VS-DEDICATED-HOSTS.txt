BARE METAL (it is used on all the purpose, cause it has the highest configure of vCPU,memory)VS DEDICATED HOSTS:


TYPES OF VIRTUALIZATION:

XEN HYPERVISOR -HVM - MANAGED BY AWS
AWS NITRO SYSTEM - AWS NITRO (AWS OWNED HYPERVISOR) - MANAGED BY AWS
BARE METAL - WE CAN EITHER USE IT AS VIRTUALIZATION OR NON-VIRUALAZTION, CAUSE WE CAN MANAGE THE VIRUTALAZATION 

While launching our instance, There is an option called Tenancy .It has three choices like

1. Shared - Run a Shared hardware Instance or Shared model

Scene:
	If we restart or stop the instance, that instance starts in another. cause multiple clients are their app in theos.(like virtualization concept) , AND IT IS NOT CHARGABLE WHEN IT IS STOP.

2. Dedicated Hosts - Run a dedicated Instance

Scene:
	If we restart or stop the instance, that instance starts in another .but sharing model. pays in per hour.IT IS NOT CHARGABLE WHEN IT IS STOP

3. Dedicated Host - launch this instance on a dedicated host or for all dedicated hosts configured instances.

Scene:
	If we restart or stop the instance, A server or rack runs in same instance. So we should pay for that WHEN IT IS STOPPED

NOTE BASICS FOR INTERVIEW AND ALSO VIRTUALZATION CONCEPT:

BY DEFAULT. SINCE VIRTUALIZATION OF HYPERVISOR OR NEW VERSION NITRO SYSTEM(AWS OWNED HYPERVISOR) ARE MANAGED BY AWS IN EC2 INSTANCE . BUT IN BARE METAL INSTANCE ARE NON-VIRTUALAZATION CONCEPT . SO WE CAN USE BARE-METAL AS EITHER VIRUTAULIZATION OF OUR OWN VM WARE SOFTWARE  OR NON-VIRUTALIZAION CONCEPT. 



DEDICATED HOSTS:(WHENEVER WE STOP OR RESTART THE INSTANCE,IT WILL STARTS IN SAME DEDICATED HOSTS)

1.VIRULAZATION CONCEPT

2. AWS MANAGES THE VIRTUALIZATION LAYER

3.IT IS CHARGABLE STATE IS STOPPED

BARE METAL:(WHEN WE STOP OR RESTART THE INSTANCE, IT WILL START IN AVAIL OF ANOTHER BARE METAL INSTANCE)

1.NON -VIRTULAZATION CONCEPT
2. WE CAN MANAGE THE VIRUTALIZATION LAYER
3. IF WE STOP , NO CHARGES
