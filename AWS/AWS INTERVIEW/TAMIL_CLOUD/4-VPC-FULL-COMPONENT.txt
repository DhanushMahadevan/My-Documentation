INTERVIEW QUESTION:

WHAT IS ROUTE PROPAGATION IN ROUTE TABLE?
  ANS: It is used to configure our vitrual private gateway to our specific route table which we are going to connect vpn to our server to client


VPC IS A BROAD NETWORK
VPC-SUBNETS:
1. How to restore the public subnet or changing vpc or subnets in the existing instance?:
  Ans: Simply,AMI that instance and whiling launching instance config whatever like vpc,subnets etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CONNECTING INSTANCES FROM PUBLIC TO PRIVATE:

2. TWO WAYS:(Connnecting by public or private ip)

Note: Saving the key file as key.ssh or key.pem

---------------------------------------------------------------------

3. DIFF B/W NAT GATEWAY AND NAT INSTANCE:

NAT GATEWAY:

1. High availability NAt Gateways in each AZ's are implemented with redundancy.
2. Not support bastion host.
3. Managed by AWS.
4. Not supported in cloud watch.
5. supports upto 40 Gbps.
6. Port forwarding is not supported.
NAT INSTANCE:

1. Use script to manage the failover b/w instances.
2. Use Bastion server.
3. Managed by us.
4. view cloudwatch alarms.
5. Depends on bandwidth of type of instances.
6. Manual port forwarding.

NOTE: 

* CHANGING A PUBLIC INSTANCE AS NAT INSTANCE:

If we want to change a instance as NAT Instance, Click the public Instance -> Action -> Networking -> Change the Source/Des Check --> Yes,Disable.

THEN, It will automatically changed as NAT Instance

After that Go to private route table -> Routes -> Add Route -> Target(instance of above configured instance)


---------------------------------------------------------------------

3. SECURITY GROUPS VS NACL:

SECURITY GROUPS:

1. Instance level protection.
2. Statefull firewall(Default return traffic is enabled which means inbound port is enough like, Establish the connection to the remote server {Inbound ssh} )
3. Allow only performed.

NACL(lowest to highest priorty rule number):

1. Subnet level protection
2. Stateless firewall(Default return traffic is denied So we should allow outbound rules also ,Inbound and outbound must be open like, {Inbound ssh} and {outbound 1024-65535})
3. Both Allow and Deny could be performed.

------------------------------------------------------------------
4. VPN Component:

Definition:
	Access AWS resource from our on-premise through VPN.

Steps to create VPN(36$ per month for vpn):

	1. Create customer gateway, put static or dynamic ip of  the vpn router.
	2. Create VPN Gateway -Attach to VPC
	3. Site-to-site Connection - Choose VPN Gateway ID and Customer Gateway
 	4. Finally, Put entry in route table ->route propagation

	5. After the entry have put, Our Site-to-site connection , Two tunnels will up which gives two tunnel ips.
	6. Download the configuration.
	7. Which downloaded as two presec key files.
	8. Config our on-premise firewall by following Downloaded presec key files.
