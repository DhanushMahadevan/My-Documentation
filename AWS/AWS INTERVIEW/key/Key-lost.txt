GET PUBLIC FROM PRIVATE :

cmd : ssh-keygen -y -f private-pem-file


METHODS:
0. Passing script to the user-data

1. CONNECT WITH MULTIPLE KEYS

2. DETACH THE VOLUME AND ATTACH TO NEW SERVER 

3. THROUGH SSM . 




1ST METHOD(Connect with Multiple keys):

PRE-REQUEST
	"SG-SSH-ANYWHERE"

Step 1: IN AWS MGMT CONSOLE TERMINAL ,CONNECT THE KEY LOSTED INSTANCES AND Generate ssh-keygen cmd from existing instance.
Step 2: Copy the newly created public key from id_rsa.pub to append it in the authorised_keys file in ~.ssh/
Step 3: Get private key from id_rsa file , to the local and save it as .pem file 



2RD METHOD(change the key ):

PRE-REQUESTS:Make sure instance is to be stopped and detach the volume

Please follow the below steps to recover the key.

STEP 0) REFER THIS PAGE : https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-solve-xfs-filesystem-has-duplicate-uuid-error/ or use this cmd: sudo mount -o rw,nouuid /dev/xvdf1  /home/ec2-user/backup/


cause we got error at wrong type fs error while mount.because of same UUID 


Step 1) Detach your root volume from your machine using AWS console.
Step 2) Launch a fresh EC2 instance(Not from your old machine AMI)
Step 3) Attach your old volume to new EC2 machine
Step 4) Now login to new ec2 machine and mount the old EBS volume
Step 5) Now go to that partition then visit home directory inside that machine and go to .ssh folder.
Step 6) Now generate a new private and public key. Then paste public key into authorized_keys file.
Step 7) Once you done with above steps, detach that volume from this ec2 machine.
Step 8) Now attach this volume to your old machine as root volume GIVE NAME xvda
Step 9) Now try to login to your old machine with the newly generated key.

3rd Method:

THROUGH SSM  :
PEM KEY ROTATION OR KEY RECOVERY:

BASIC :
 As a Cloud Eng, They will change(rotate) their pem key per 2 or 3 months for security purpose.

ROTATING KEY BY SSM:
	Quest arising why do we go for ssm, Cause we don't login every single instance to rotate our key, So we just simply done by SSM.

STEPS:
1. SPIN UP A INSTANCE

2. ROLE FOR EC2FORSSMROLE

3. UPDATE THAT ROLE TO THE INSTANCE

4. INSTALL SSM AGENT TO OUR INSTANCE (GOOGLE IT THE SSM AGENT PRESENTED IN AWS OFFICAL DOCS).

5. CHECK STATUS OF THE SSM-AGENT BY A CMD: systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent.

6. go to the SSM page in aws site.

7. To see the managed instance option, Check our instance is display or not.

8. do cmd: ssh-keygen 

9. Copy the public key 

10. Pass the below script to the run cmd option in SSM page.

#To add public key in run command

#!/bin/bash
/bin/echo -e "Public-key-content" > /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys

11. Choose AWS-RunShellScript option

12. In Command parameters - paste the  above (10th step  script content)

13. In Targets , Specify Instance tags or  choose the instances

SCENARIO :
 IN SOME CASES, OUR COMPANY USES SOME TAG FOR WHOLE INSTANCE 
eg: 500 instance have same tag name, it will reflect that 500 instances 

14. Click Run button or go through what options are there.

15. Finally check our old private key is connected or not and login as newly created private key
