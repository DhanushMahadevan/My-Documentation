1.ifconfig (Interface config):
sudo apt install net-tools
-----------------------------
which we can eth0)
*ifconfig -s - which show what are the packets are going up and down 
where,
RX - received traffic packets or incoming traffic
TX - transmitted traffic packets or  outgoing traffic 
 
*ifconfig -v(verbose) (same as ifconfig)
---------------------------------------------
2.ping (packet internet graper)
-------------------------------
ping -c 5 -i 3 ip_addr - which 3 denotes time interval b/w ping each packet
pinf -c 5 -s 200 ip_addr -packet 200 size
-------------------------------
3.traceroute( for troubleshooting purpose)
traceroute is better than mtr
apt install traceroute
------------------------
How the packet getting routed.how the packtes are routed to reach the destination by routers.

cases:
if so may firwalls are there, we can identify when will our packet get dropped
-----------------------------------------
4.mtr
-apt install mtr


5. pathping

6. telnet
--------------
telphone network - To find a particular port is open or closed
every app have specific port.  
ssh -22
rdp - 3389
dns -53
http -80
httpd -443
smb -445
 
Note:
we will check this cmd in aws as well as linux terminal syntax as  telnet ip_addr port_num
but destination machine must be in web service started.

if any fails that either be firewall or or internet speed(packets are dropped)
--------------------------

7.netstat -a 
- which we can see the all the listening ports.

* netstat -a | grep -i LISTENING  or netstat  -anptl | grep -i LISTENING
  
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHILE PERFROMING WEB DEPLOY:
------------------------------
watch -n 1 netstat -a | grep -i LISTENING
  - every one second we will see the status of listening ports

- Do duplicate the session

- In duplicate session,To install apache or any server pack and start the service
