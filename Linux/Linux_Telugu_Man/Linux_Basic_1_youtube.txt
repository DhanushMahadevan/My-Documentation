.bashrc (it starts when pc is get started)

alias - it use full when using kubernets and docker we just simply do alias.



1. .BASHRC (IMPORTANT NOTE : EVERY USER HAS UNQIUE BASHRC)

SCENARIO:
WHEN A MACHINE IS UP ,  .BASHRC HELPS START OUR MACHINE

AWESOME CMDS IN ALIAS:
- alias myuser='sudo cat /etc/passwd | grep -i 'ec2-user'
- alias checkuser='sudo cat /etc/passwd | grep -i'
so we can type checkuser ec2-user it will show our info in passwd file

NOTE:
BUT IT IS NOT SHOWED IN DUPLCATE SESSION,IT'S JUST TEMP SO WE NEED TO CHANGE IT AS PERMENANT

NANO EDITOR - PRESS CTRL + - TO CTRL + V GO TO THE LAST LINE OF TH FILE


STPES TO SAVE ALIAS PERMENANTLY:

1. DO SOME ALIAS CMD SOMTHING OR ABOVE CMDS.
2. OPEN .BASHRC FILE
3. WRITE  ALIAS CMD TO THE LAST LINE
4. FINALLY TYPE IN TERMINAL, CMD AS source .bashrc

UNALIAS : unalias cmd_name


UNBELIVABLE NOTE:

BASHRC FILE ARE START WHEN MACHINE IS START
SIMILARLY OUR AWS USERDATA ARE STORED IN BASHRC ,BUT I CAN'T SEE ANY CMDS IN AWS TERMINAL WHEN USERDATA (BOOSTRAPING). GO THROUGH 19_TASK FILE
WHATEVER CMS ARE IN BASHRC IT WILL PERFORM WHEN A MACHINE IS STARTED UP AND DO DUPLICATE SESSION ALSO
