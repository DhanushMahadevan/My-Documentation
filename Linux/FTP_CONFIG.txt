FTP CONFIG( concs: It shares only files):

port number: 20(data transfer) ,21(connection)

PRE-REQUESTS:

1. MINIMUM 2 MACHINES TO BE TESTED CLIENT(FTP PKG) AND SERVER(VSFTP)

2. MAKE SURE PINGING EACH OTHER MACHINES.

3 . Sg - all tcp - if not - we can't see pub file in /var/ftp it is routed as dynamic port

4. If any changes in config file . And do restart the vsftpd service

TWO TYPES:

ANONYMOUS AND NORMAL USER


ANONYMOUS:(Cons: we should only view in first parent dir)
----------------------------------
STEPS:

1. Start & enable the vsftpd in server

2. Check the config file in anonymous_enable to Yes server. ftp <server-ip> in the client
Username and password as anonymous in client

3. Download winscp in windows and type ftp protocol.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If  upload to the root from anonymous users:

1. we can't upload to the root by default, Cause we have selinux in the vsftpd pkg.Check the config file in anon_upload to Yes server. So enable the boolean value.

2.getsebool -a | grep ftp 

3. setsebool -P ftpd_anon_write {on or 1}

4. getenforce --> to enforcing the policy of bool function in ftp

5.chown ftp:ftp /var/pub -R 

6. now we can copy anonymous from winscp or filezilla to the server or In linux put <filename> in ftp prompt to upload the files to server

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we create a dir from client to server:

1. we can't create a dir to the root by default, Cause we have selinux in th vsftpd pkg.Check the config file in anon_mkdir_write_enable to Yes server.

2. Now we can create a dir from client to server



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NORMAL USER A/C:

1. Make sure disable anonymous priviledges in config file.Check the config file as local_enable,write_enable=yes

2. If we need log for ftp . xferlog_enable=yes

3. Note, inside vsftpd dir , ftp_users which defines the listed users are not accessed in ftp

4. create users and files from server .do ftp <ip> and use username as created user and passwd instead of anonymous in client machine


5. SCENARIO:

What if i will face the block 1000 users for ftp server access

2 WAYS:

i). Edit ftp_users in vsftpd dir (Rarely)

ii). Edit config file and add the line as userlist_deny=NO. cause userlist_deny=yes(default)

* cat user_list in vsftpd dir

The above 2 and 3 steps defines the user_list contains allow user in ftp server
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

chroot:(Securing the server by editing the config files as mentioned below)

Scenario:
Without chroot, we can access file permission of other users as "r" which means we can download the file with read permission of other users like /etc for etc...

So we can use chroot, to restrict the above scenario.


STEPS:

1. Edit the config and uncomment the chroot_local_users,chroot_list_enable=YES

2. And add the line allow_writeable_chroot=yes 

3. ftp <server-ip> on client 

4. now check cd /etc -> output: failed to change dir
